here's your prompt:

Build a full-stack adaptive learning platform (like Coursera) called "LearnAI".

Tech Stack

React + Tailwind CSS frontend

All AI features call the backend API (base URL configurable)

Clean, modern UI similar to Coursera/Udemy

Backend API

Base URL: http://localhost:8000 (make it configurable in a config file)

All requests except login/register need header: Authorization: Bearer <token>

Auth endpoints

POST /api/auth/register — {email, password, full_name}

POST /api/auth/login — {email, password} → returns {access_token}

GET /api/auth/me → returns user info

Course endpoints

POST /api/fullcourse/create — multipart form with file (syllabus upload) → returns course with topics

POST /api/oneshot/create — multipart form with file → returns course with topics

GET /api/fullcourse/ — list all full courses

GET /api/oneshot/ — list all oneshot courses

GET /api/fullcourse/{course_id} — get single course

Course response shape

{
  "id": "uuid",

    }
  ]
}


Quiz endpoints

GET /api/quiz/full-test/{topic_id} → 15 questions mixed difficulty

GET /api/quiz/notebook/{topic_id} → returns notebook cells

GET /api/quiz/progress/{course_id} → returns per-chapter progress with difficulty and accuracy

Comprehension endpoints

POST /api/doc-comprehension/upload — file upload → {session_id, text}

POST /api/doc-comprehension/ask — {question, session_id, text} → {answer}

POST /api/video-comprehension/extract — {url} → {session_id, text}

On success, redirect to the course page

5. Course page (main learning view — make this look like Coursera)

Left sidebar: chapter list with progress indicators (locked/unlocked/completed icons)

Main content area: renders chapter content as markdown with syntax highlighting for code

Top bar: course title, progress bar showing % completed

Each chapter shows:

Content (markdown rendered, code blocks highlighted)

AI Summary pill at the top ("TL;DR: ...")

"Take Chapter Quiz" button at the bottom of each chapter

"Full Test" button

UI/UX Requirements

Color scheme: Deep navy + electric blue accent (like a modern edtech platform)

Typography: Clean, readable — Inter or similar

Course page: Must feel like Coursera — sidebar navigation, clean content area, progress tracking

Code blocks: Syntax highlighted, dark theme, copy button

Markdown rendering: Full markdown support including tables, bold, italic, lists

Responsive: Works on mobile and desktop

Loading states: Skeleton loaders, not spinners where possible

Animations: Subtle — page transitions, quiz answer feedback animations

Multilingual UI: Add a language selector in the navbar. Support English, Hindi, Spanish, French, Arabic. All static UI text should switch language. (Course content stays in original language)

Notebook viewer: When notebook cells exist, show them in a Jupyter-style interface — alternating markdown and code cells, each code cell has a copy button

Important notes

Backend API base URL should be in a single config file at the top so it's easy to change

JWT token stored in localStorage, auto-redirect to login if 401

All API errors should show as toast notifications

The quiz flow is adaptive — after submitting quiz, show the next difficulty prominently so user knows the system is adjusting for them
